# K-Means
Clusters the data into k groups where k  is predefined.     Select k points at random as cluster centers.     Assign objects to their closest cluster center according to the Euclidean distance function.     Calculate the centroid or mean of all objects in each cluster.     Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 until the same points are assigned to each cluster in consecutive rounds.
